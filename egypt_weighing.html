    <p>In ancient Egyptian belief, death was not the end, but a transition to another life — a life that could only be earned through moral purity and truth. The key to entering the eternal paradise known as the Field of Reeds lay in a deeply symbolic ritual: the Weighing of the Heart, one of the most profound and iconic scenes in Egyptian mythology.</p>
    <p>According to the sacred texts inscribed on tomb walls and papyrus scrolls, when a person died, their soul journeyed to the Hall of Ma’at, the divine court of the afterlife. There, they would be judged by Osiris, god of the dead, and a tribunal of 42 divine assessors. The person’s heart — believed to be the seat of their emotions, memory, and morality — was weighed on a great golden scale against the Feather of Ma’at, the goddess of truth, justice, and cosmic order.</p>
    
    <p>If the heart was light and balanced, having lived truthfully and without burdened guilt, the soul would pass the test. They would be granted eternal life in the lush, peaceful fields beyond the sunset — a place where crops grew abundantly and loved ones reunited. But if the heart was heavy with sin or deceit, the scales would tip, and the soul would face a terrible fate.</p>
    
    <p>Waiting beside the scale was Ammit, the “Devourer of the Dead,” a terrifying beast with the head of a crocodile, the front of a lion, and the hindquarters of a hippopotamus. If the heart failed the test, Ammit would consume it entirely, dooming the soul to complete oblivion — a second death from which there was no return.</p>
    
    <p>To prepare for this judgment, Egyptians lived by the principles of Ma’at: truth, balance, respect, and harmony. They also recited spells from the Book of the Dead, hoping to declare their innocence before the gods. These declarations, called the “Negative Confessions,” included statements like:</p>
    <p>“I have not stolen.”</p>
    <p>“I have not told lies.”</p>
    <p>“I have not caused pain.”</p>
    
    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>The Weighing of the Heart was more than mythology — it was the moral compass of ancient Egyptian society. It guided how people treated one another and how they honored the gods, the land, and their ancestors. It taught that our actions on Earth shaped our eternity.</p>
    <p>This myth remains one of the most powerful metaphors for justice and accountability in ancient religious systems. It also influenced later concepts of divine judgment found in other cultures and faiths.</p>

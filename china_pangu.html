    <p>Long before the world took form, there was only chaos — a swirling, silent cosmic egg that held all elements of the universe in darkness. Inside this egg, asleep for 18,000 years, was a giant named Pangu. Half-man, half-dragon, and filled with immense power, Pangu lay dormant as opposites churned around him: Yin and Yang, dark and light, heavy and light, order and disorder.</p>
    
    <p>Then, suddenly, Pangu awoke.</p>
        
    <p>With a mighty roar and a swing of his colossal axe, Pangu split the egg in two. The lighter elements — air, warmth, and light — floated up to become the sky. The heavier elements — solid, cool, and dense — fell to become the earth. But Pangu knew the sky and earth might collapse back together, so he stood between them, pushing them apart with all his strength.</p>
    
    <p>Every day for 18,000 more years, Pangu grew taller — some say by 10 feet each day — while the sky rose higher and the earth grew thicker. His body became the bridge that held the universe in balance. Eventually, when he had ensured the separation was permanent, Pangu laid down to rest — and died.</p>
    
    <p>But his death was not the end. His body transformed into the world we know today. His breath became the wind and clouds. His voice turned into thunder. His eyes became the sun and the moon. His limbs formed mountains and valleys. His blood flowed into rivers, his veins became paths and roads, and his hair sprouted into forests and grasslands. Even his flesh nourished the soil, and his bones formed the great stones of the earth. The fleas on his skin, touched by the breath of life, became the first animals.</p>
    
    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>The story of Pangu reflects deep Taoist concepts of balance, transformation, and the harmony of opposites. He is the ultimate symbol of sacrifice and creation — giving everything, even his life, to bring the world into being. Unlike myths of war or rivalry, Pangu’s tale shows creation as a process of divine labor and cosmic order.</p>
    <p>Though the myth of Pangu developed later in Chinese history, around the Han dynasty, it remains one of the most powerful origin stories in East Asian cosmology. His legend continues to inspire Chinese philosophy, art, and literature.</p>

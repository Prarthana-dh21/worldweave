    <!--============== CONTENT AREA 2 ===============-->
    <p>In ancient Greece, beauty was both a gift and a curse. Medusa, once a stunning maiden with long flowing hair and eyes that gleamed like the sea, served as a priestess in the sacred temple of Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom and war. Medusa vowed to remain pure and loyal to the goddess, honoring the rules of chastity required by temple service.</p>
    <p>But fate turned cruel. One day, the god of the sea, Poseidon, driven by desire or vengeance, violated Medusa in Athena’s temple. Instead of punishing the offender, Athena turned her rage on Medusa, whom she saw as having defiled her sacred space. In a moment of divine fury, Athena transformed Medusa’s beautiful hair into writhing snakes, and cursed her with a gaze that turned anyone who looked into her eyes to stone.</p>
        
    <p>Banished to a remote island, Medusa became a symbol of terror — a Gorgon, feared by gods and mortals alike. Yet beneath the monstrous exterior was a tragic figure: a woman punished not for wrongdoing, but for being a victim. Some versions say Athena’s act was one of twisted mercy — making Medusa so fearsome that no man would ever harm her again.</p>
    
    <p>Years later, the hero Perseus was sent on a quest to slay Medusa and bring back her head. With gifts from the gods — Hermes’ winged sandals, Hades’ helm of invisibility, and a mirrored shield from Athena — he approached the Gorgon. Using the reflection to avoid her deadly gaze, Perseus beheaded Medusa as she slept.</p>
    
    <p>But even in death, Medusa’s power endured. From her blood sprang Pegasus, the winged horse, and Chrysaor, a golden warrior. Her severed head, given to Athena, was mounted on the goddess’s shield, the Aegis, to ward off evil.</p>
    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    <p>Medusa's story has evolved over time. In ancient myths, she was a monster, but later interpretations — especially in modern feminist thought — view her as a symbol of injustice, strength, and the destructive power of misunderstood women. Her transformation speaks to the way society punishes victims, and her image, once feared, is now often reclaimed as one of resilience and rage.</p>
    <p>Medusa continues to inspire art, literature, and cultural commentary, her gaze as powerful in spirit as it was in myth.</p>

    <!--============== CONTENT AREA 2 ===============-->
    <p>High in the night sky, when the moon shines at its fullest, many in China and across East Asia look up and think of Chang’e, the beautiful moon goddess who lives in solitude on the silver orb. Her story is one of love, sacrifice, and longing, and it’s been passed down for thousands of years in poetry, paintings, festivals, and legends — especially during the Mid-Autumn Festival, a time of family reunion and moon gazing.</p>
    
    <p>Long ago, in an age when ten suns scorched the Earth and rivers dried to dust, a hero named Hou Yi, a mighty archer, saved humanity by shooting down nine of the suns, leaving only one to light the world. As a reward for his bravery, the Queen Mother of the West gave him a divine elixir — a potion of immortality. But Hou Yi loved his wife, Chang’e, more than eternal life. He chose not to drink the elixir, hiding it instead to live a mortal life by her side.</p>
        
    <p>One day, while Hou Yi was away, a greedy apprentice tried to steal the elixir. To protect it, Chang’e had no choice but to drink the potion herself. Immediately, she began to float — her body growing lighter, rising into the sky. She drifted higher and higher until she reached the moon, where she made her new home. There, in a cold and lonely palace, she remains to this day.</p>
    
    <p>Hou Yi was heartbroken. Every night, he looked up at the moon, hoping to see her face. To honour her, he placed her favourite foods and mooncakes on an altar. The tradition continues to this day, as families gather during the Mid-Autumn Festival to eat, light lanterns, and share stories about Chang’e.</p>
    
    <p>In some versions of the tale, Chang’e is accompanied by Jade Rabbit, a celestial creature who pounds herbs into the elixir of immortality. Others say she lives in sadness, yearning to be reunited with Hou Yi — a love lost to the heavens, visible only in moonlight.</p>
    
    <h2>Cultural Significance</h2>
    
    <p>The story of Chang’e is at the heart of the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of China’s most cherished holidays. Her tale reflects themes of devotion, sacrifice, and the price of immortality. Unlike many myths that focus on war or conquest, Chang’e’s story is quiet and emotional, a reflection on human fragility and eternal longing.</p>
    
    <p>She is a symbol of grace, beauty, and mystery, and her name still inspires art, music, and even modern science — China’s lunar missions are named the Chang’e program, honouring the goddess who lives on the moon.</p>
